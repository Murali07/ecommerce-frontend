## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
A Full-Stack Ecommerce application that built using React, Redux, MongoDB, Nodejs, ExpressJS and JWT Authentication with Stripe payment system that allows admin to create, update and delete products and buyers to save products to cart and purchase via Stripe card payment system. I have implemented login and signup page for new buyers.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
```
Create an account if you don't have on TMDB. Because I use its free API to consume movie/tv data.
```

```
And then follow the documentation to create API Key.
```

```
Finally, if you use v3 of TMDB API, create a file named .env, and then paste the API Key you just created.
```

Install latest version of npm

- npm
  ```
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### :gear: Installation

1. Clone the project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Murali07/Netflix-Clone.git
   ```
2. Go to project directory and Install NPM packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create .env file
   
4. Request an API key from TMDB and add it to your .env
   ```
   API_KEY=""

   TMDB_BASE_URL = "https://api.themoviedb.org/"
   ```
5. In a new directory, clone the backend and follow installation instructions on its README
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Murali07/Netflix-Clone/tree/netflix-backend
   ```
6. You should now have the server running locally. Add the url to your .env
   ```
   SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
7. Start the application
   ```
   npm start
   ```
