**Features**
- Login/Signup User Account
- Cart Add/Remove Items
- Purchase products
- Products Pagination
- Product Search
- My Orders
- Admin: Dashboard access to only admin roles
- Admin: Update Order Status

**1. Frontend: React, Redux, Cloudinary, Socket.IO:**

- Set up your project using Create React App or another preferred method.
- Create components for different parts of your application: product listing, product details, cart, checkout, user profile, etc.
- Implement Redux for managing the application state, including cart items and user authentication status. 
- Cloudinary is used for image management, allowing you to upload, store, and retrieve product images efficiently.
- Socket.IO enables real-time communication, which could be used for features like live chat support or instant notifications to users about order updates.

**2. Backend: Node.js and Express:**

- Set up a Node.js project and initialize it using npm or yarn.
- Create routes and controllers for various functionalities such as product management, user authentication, cart management, and payment processing.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication for user login and registration.
- Connect your backend to MongoDB to store user data, product information, cart items, etc.

**3. Database: MongoDB:**

- Design your database schema to store products, users, carts, and orders.
- Use a library like Mongoose to interact with MongoDB from your Node.js application.
- Create models for products, users, carts, and orders, and define their relationships.

**4. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**

- Implement a user authentication system using JWT.
- Allow users to sign up and log in securely, generating tokens upon successful authentication.
- Protect certain routes on your backend using middleware that verifies JWT tokens.

**5. Admin Panel:**

- Implement an admin panel that's protected by authentication.
- Create functionalities for admin to manage products: create, update, and delete products.

**6. Stripe Integration for Payments:**

- Set up a Stripe account and get your API keys.
- Integrate Stripe on the frontend by using Stripe Elements to create a secure payment form.
- Handle the frontend and backend communication for processing payments.

- Implement features like adding/removing items from the cart, viewing cart contents, and checking out.
- Provide feedback to users about the status of their orders and payments.

**8. Deployment:**
